# IMDB Sentiment Classification

A progressive comparison of three NLP approaches on the [IMDB 50K Movie Reviews](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imdb) dataset, from a classical ML baseline through deep learning and up to a fine-tuned transformer.

## Model Comparison

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | Latency / Sample | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TF-IDF + Logistic Regression | ~0.8997 | ~0.9001 | ~0.01 ms | Strong baseline; interpretable |
| Bidirectional LSTM + GloVe | ~0.8378 | ~0.8411 | ~3.0 ms | Sequential context; pre-trained embeddings |
| DistilBERT (fine-tuned) | ~0.9320 | ~0.9321 | ~12 ms | Best accuracy; highest compute cost |

> Exact numbers are written to `results/` after each notebook runs.

## Approach Summary

### 1. `baseline.ipynb`: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
- Regex-based text cleaning (HTML stripping, lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- `TfidfVectorizer` with unigrams + bigrams, 50k vocabulary, sublinear TF scaling
- `LogisticRegression` (L2, lbfgs solver)
- Outputs: accuracy, F1, confusion matrix, top predictive features

### 2. `lstm.ipynb`: Bidirectional LSTM + GloVe
- Same preprocessing pipeline
- Keras `Tokenizer` → integer sequences → padding to length 256
- GloVe 6B 100d embeddings (auto-downloaded) loaded into a frozen `Embedding` layer
- Two stacked `Bidirectional(LSTM)` layers + Dense head
- `EarlyStopping` + `ReduceLROnPlateau` callbacks
- Outputs: training curves (accuracy + loss), confusion matrix

### 3. `bert.ipynb`: DistilBERT Fine-tuning
- `DistilBertTokenizerFast` with truncation/padding to 256 tokens
- `DistilBertForSequenceClassification` (`distilbert-base-uncased`, 66M params)
- HuggingFace `Trainer` with warmup, weight decay, early stopping
- Mixed precision (fp16) on GPU automatically enabled
- Per-sample inference latency benchmark (100-run average)
- Demo inference function included

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- (Optional but recommended) CUDA-capable GPU for BERT training

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run notebooks in order

```bash
jupyter notebook baseline.ipynb
jupyter notebook lstm.ipynb
jupyter notebook bert.ipynb
```

Each notebook saves its metrics to `results/` as a JSON file and saves plots as PNGs.

## Key Design Decisions

- **GloVe download** is handled automatically in `lstm.ipynb` if the file is not found locally.
- **DistilBERT** is used over full BERT for faster training (~40% fewer parameters) with minimal accuracy trade-off.
- **`report_to='none'`** in TrainingArguments keeps BERT training output clean without requiring wandb/tensorboard.
- All random seeds are fixed (`RANDOM_SEED = 42`) for reproducibility.
